               <h2 class="text-center">Pereira vs Hill</h2>
               <p>
                  The wild storm that is Alex Pereira, a two-division UFC champion, was matched against former Light Heavyweight champion, Jamahal Hill, 
                  for the main event of UFC 300. Jamahal relinquished the belt after an injury which put him out for months. Seeking to reclaim his title, former champion 
                  Hill seems to have just another victim of Pereira's monstrous left hook after being knocked down and finished in just the first round. 
                  Despite Pereira's prowess, many fighters and analysts within the UFC team said to watch out for Jamahal's power against Alex, who has been knocked
                  out before. However, this fight simply proves the skill and godly power of Alex "Poatan (Stone Hand)" Pereira.

               <h2 class="text-center">Zhang vs Yan</h2>
               <p>
                    The two chinese fighters at the top of the women's Straweight division go to war as Yan Xiaonan faces the current all-time division best, Zhang Weili. In round 1, Zhang out-grapples Yan and locks in a tight 
                    a rear-naked-choke in the final seconds. Yan fights for her life and manages to stay concious through the bell, passing out right as the clock hits zero.
                    The ref allows the fight to continue since Yan survived until the round ended, and the to battle on for the next 4 rounds. Yan displays a high level of striking prowess against the well-rounded champ.
                    However, using her far superiour grappling, Zhang takes it to the ground and hits Yan with many grounded strikes, taking the win over all 5 rounds and retaining her belt.

               <h2 class="text-center">Holloway vs Gaethje</h2>
               <p>
                Former featherweight champion, legend, and infamous division gatekeeper, Max "Blessed" Holloaway, moves up a weight class to fight the hard-hitting, "Baddest MF" title holding,
                Justin Gaethje: "The Human Highlight". Leading up to the fight, the odds were lopsided, Max was the obvious underdog who was seen as 
                the next victim of Gaethje's immense power. Instead, Holloway displayed the absolute levels between him and Gaethje.
                He outclassed the brawler style of Gaethje with his masterful, technical kickboxing for 4 rounds. In the final 10 seconds, Holloway pointed to the canvas, a signature move
                asking his opponent for an all out brawl to the finish line. Accepting the request, for 9 seconds, they threw everything they had at one another.
                As the clock ticked to 1 second left, Holloway landed a flush right hand and one of the best knock-outs in UFC history, earning himself a $600k bonus.
                "Blessed is best", he once said, proving himself correct. The two delivered one of the best performances for fans of all time.

                <h2 class="text-center">Tsarukyan vs Oliveira</h2>
                <p>
                    Up-and-coming contender Arman Tsarukyan comes off a devastating K/O win over Beneil Dariush and faces former champ and current #1 ranked Lightweight, Charles Oliveira. Seeking a rematch with current champion,
                    Islam Makhachev, Tsarukyan must face his toughest challenge on the road yet in the fan-favorite, all-time most finishes record holder, Charles Oliveira.
                    Escaping a tight guillotine and reversing positions in round one, Tsarukyan was able to survive the ground game, losing that round however. He was the first in years to truly damage Oliveira with hard grounded elbows in round 2 after landing a good takedown into top-mount.
                    In a controversial 3rd round, Tsarukyan was able to wait out the clock and prevent a D'arce submission from Oliveira. In a split decision, the judges 
                    favored him over Oliveira, taking a great win for the record and heading forward to be next in line for the belt.

                <h2 class="text-center">Nickal vs Brundage</h2>
                    <p>
                        The UFC PR machine is working hard as up-and-coming, hyped-up Middleweight fighter, Bo Nickal faces Cody Brundage on the main card of the event.
                        The outcome of the fight was no surprise as the odds were the most one sided in UFC history with 96% betting odds in favor of Nickal.
                        Nickal submits Brundage in round 2, eating up the free meal the UFC matchmakers gave him.
